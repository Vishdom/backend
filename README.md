# Backend Learning Repo

This repository is part of my 6-month full-stack + data science learning journey.  
It will contain backend projects, exercises, and progress notes.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- APIs & Authentication

## Structure
- `/projects` → small backend projects
- `/exercises` → weekly practice exercises
- `/notes` → learnings and documentation
